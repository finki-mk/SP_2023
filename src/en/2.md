# Structural Programming
## Auditory exercise 2

***

### 1. Introduction to C++

- The C++ language was developed in the Bell Laboratories and was initially named "C with Classes."
- The name "C++" includes operations to enhance the C language, indicating that C++ is an extended version of C with additional capabilities.
- C++ incorporates many features of the C language, supplemented with additional mechanisms for object-oriented programming (OOP).
- The C++ compiler can also be used to compile C programs.

### 2. Program Structure

Reminder: The source code of the C++ programming language is organized into functions.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  variable declaration;
  program statements;
}
```

### 3. Basic C++ Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// main function
int main() {
  /*
  print messages to the screen
  */
  cout << "Welcome to FINKI!" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

- `#include` - directive to include external libraries.
- `<iostream>` - library for working with standard input/output streams (keyboard, screen).
- `cout` - global object for working with the output stream (screen).
- `<<` - operator for printing to the output stream (screen).

### 4. Input/Output Streams in C++ (`<iostream>`)

In C++, for working with input/output streams, we use the operators:
- `<<` from the `cout` object (`cout <<`)
- `>>` from the `cin` object (`cin >>`)

These objects are part of the standard library `iostream`, which is included in the program using the directive `#include <iostream>` at the beginning of the code.

Example:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int value;
   cout << "Enter a value for the variable value: ";
   cin >> value;
   cout << "The entered value is: " << value << '\n';
}
```

### 5. Variables

- Variables are symbolic names for locations in memory where values are stored.
- All variables must be declared before they are used.
- Each time a new value is assigned to a variable, the old value is overwritten.

#### 5.1. Variable Declaration in C++

In the C++ programming language, variables are declared with the following syntax:

```cpp
data_type variable_name = initial_value;
```

- `data_type` refers to the type of data that the variable will store, such as an integer, a floating-point number, a character, etc.
- `variable_name` denotes the name of the variable, which should be unique within a given code block. Variable names can be a combination of letters, digits, and the underscore character (`_`), but they must start with a letter or an underscore. Variable names should clearly indicate what is stored in them.
- When declaring a variable, it is optional to provide an initial value.

Examples of variable declarations of different types:
```cpp
int number = 5;
float price = 7.99;
char letter = 'a';
bool is_true = true;
```

#### 5.2. Variable Types in C++
| Integer      | Character   | Floating-Point | Boolean  |
|:------------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:--------:|
| int          | char        | float          | bool     |
| short        |             | double         |          |
| long         |             | long double    |          |

### 6. Comments

Comments are used for explanations or documentation within the source code. There are two types of comments:

- Single-line comments:
```cpp
// This is a single-line comment
```

- Multi-line comments:
```cpp
/*
This is a
multi-line comment
*/
```

### 7. Operators

Operators are applied to numbers (integers or decimals):

| Operator  | Operation       |
|:---------:|:---------------:|
| +         | Addition        |
| -         | Subtraction     |
| *         | Multiplication  |
| /         | Division        |
| %         | Modulus (remainder when dividing) |

### 8. Exercises
#### 8.1. Exercise 1
Write a program that calculates the value of the mathematical expression: x = 3/2 + (5 - 46*5/12)

    float x = 3.0 / 2 + (5 - 46 * 5.0 / 12);
    cout << "x = " << x << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### 8.2. Exercise 2

    return 0;
}
```

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float a = 5.0;
    float b = 7.5;
    float c = 10.2;
    float perimeter = a + b + c;
    float s = perimeter / 2;
    float area = s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c);

    cout << "The remainder when 19 is divided by 2 is: " << num % 2 << endl;
    cout << "The remainder when 19 is divided by 3 is: " << num % 3 << endl;
    cout << "The remainder when 19 is divided by 5 is: " << num % 5 << endl;
    cout << "The remainder when 19 is divided by 8 is: " << num % 8 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### 8.6. Exercise 6

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float radius;
    cin >> radius;

    float perimeter = 2 * radius * 3.14;
    float area = radius * radius * 3.14;

    cout << "Perimeter = " << perimeter << endl;
    cout << "Area = " << area << endl;
    return 0;

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;

    cout << x << " + " << y << " = " << x + y << endl;

- **Note:** Each character is represented by an ASCII number.

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char uppercase;
    cout << "Enter an uppercase letter: " << endl;
    cin >> uppercase;
    cout << uppercase << " is written in lowercase as " << char(uppercase + ('a' - 'A')) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### 8.9. Exercise 9
Write a program that reads the price of a product from the keyboard and then prints its price with added value-added tax (VAT).

Hint: VAT is 18% of the initial price.

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    float price;
    cout << "Enter the product price: ";
    cin >> price;
    cout << "The total price of the product is " << price * 1.18;
    return 0;
}
```

#### 8.10. Exercise 10
Write a program that reads the price of a product, the number of installments, and the interest rate (the interest rate is a number expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100). The program should print the installment amount and the total amount to be paid for the product.

Hint: Calculate the total amount and then the installment.

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    float price, interestRate, installment, total;
    int installments;
    cout << "Enter the product price: " << endl;
    cin >> price;
    cout << "Enter the number of installments: ";
    cin >> installments;
    cout << "Enter the interest rate: ";
    cin >> interestRate;
    total = price * (1 + interestRate / 100);
    installment = total / installments;
    cout

 << "One installment will be: " << installment << endl;
    cout << "The total amount paid will be: " << total;
    return 0;
}
```

#### 8.11. Exercise 11
Write a program that reads a three-digit integer from the keyboard. The program should print the most significant and least significant digits of the number.

Example: If you enter the number 795, the program will print: `The most significant digit is 7, and the least significant is 5.`

Hint: Use integer division and the modulo operator.

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int number;
    cout << "Enter the number: ";
    cin >> number;
    cout << "The most significant digit is " << (number / 100);
    cout << ", and the least significant digit is " << (number % 10);
    return 0;
}
```

#### 8.12. Exercise 12
Write a program that reads a date in the format (ddmmyyyy) from the keyboard. The program should print the day and the month of the birthdate.

Example: If you enter the number 18091992, the program will print: `18.9`

Hint: Use integer division and the modulo operator.

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    long int date;
    int day, month;
    cout << "Enter your birthdate: ";
    cin >> date;
    day = date / 1000000;
    month = (date / 10000) % 100;
    cout << "Your birthdate is " << day << "." << month;
    return 0;
}
```
