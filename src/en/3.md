# Structural Programming
## Tutorial 3

### 1. Operators in C++

#### 1.1. Relational Operators

They can be applied to any comparable data types, and the result is an integer: 0 (false) or 1 (true).

| Operator    | Meaning         |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| <           | Less than       |
| <=          | Less than or equal to |
| >           | Greater than    |
| >=          | Greater than or equal to |
| ==          | Equality        |
| !=          | Inequality (difference) |

#### 1.2. Logical Operators

They are most commonly used in combination with relational operators to form complex logical expressions, which again return a result of 0 or 1.

| Operator    | Meaning         |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| &&          | Logical AND     |
| \|\|         | Logical OR      |
| !           | Negation (NOT)  |

Example:
```cpp
int a = 5 && 0; // a = 0;
a = 2 && 5;     // a = 1;
a = 0 || 5;     // a = 1;
a = !0;         // a = 1;
a = !5;         // a = 0;
```

#### 1.3. Assignment Operator

- All expressions have values, even those containing `=`.
- The value of such an expression is the value of the expression on the right-hand side.
- Therefore, assignment of the following form is possible:
```cpp
x = (y = 10) * (z = 5);
x = y = z = 20;
```

#### 1.4. Increment and Decrement Operators

- Increment operator ++ (increases the value of the operand by 1).
- Decrement operator -- (decreases the value of the operand by 1).
- They can be used in prefix or postfix notation:

a) Prefix

The value of the variable is increased before the expression in which it participates is calculated.
```cpp
a = ++b;
```

b) Postfix

The value of the variable is increased after the expression is calculated.
```cpp
a = b++;
```

#### 1.5. Compound Operators: A Combination of an Assignment Operator and Another Operator

- `+=` operator
```cpp
a += 5;     // a = a + 5;
a += b * c; // a = a + b * c;
```

- `-=` operator
```cpp
a -= 3;     // a = a - 3;
```

- `*=` operator
```cpp
a *= 3;     // a = a * 3;
```

- `/=` operator
```cpp
a /= 3;     // a = a / 3;
```

- `%=` operator
```cpp
a %= 3;     // a = a % 3;
```

### 2. Control Structures for Selection: if-else
<img src="../img/if_en.png">

```cpp
if (condition) {
    statements_if_true;
} 
else {
    statements_if_false;
}
```

Example: What will it print?
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int m = 5, n = 10;
    if (m > n)
        ++m;
    ++n;
    cout << "m = " << m << ", n = " << n;
    return 0;
}
```
Solution:
`m = 5, n = 11`

### 3. Exercises
#### 3.1. Exercise 1
Write a program that reads a character from the keyboard and prints 1 if it is a lowercase letter or 0 if it is an uppercase letter.

* Bonus: Check if the character is a digit.

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    char ch;
    int result;
    cout << "Enter a character: ";
    cin >> ch;
    result = (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z');
    cout << result;
    return 0;
}
```
Bonus solution:
```cpp
result = (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9');
```


#### 3.8. Exercise 8
Write a program that will print the maximum of two numbers whose values are read from the keyboard.

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cout << "Enter 2 numbers: " << endl;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a > b)
        cout << "Maximum: " << a;
    else
        cout << "Maximum: " << b;
    return 0;
}
```
Solution 2 (without if-else):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b, max;
    cout << "Enter 2 numbers: " << endl;
    cin >> a >> b;
    max = (a > b) ? a : b;
    cout << "Maximum: " << max;
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3.9. Exercise 9
Write a program that checks if a given year, read from the keyboard, is a leap year or not and prints an appropriate message.

Examples of leap years:
1976, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012...

Hint: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int year;
    cout << "Enter a year: " << endl;
    cin >> year;
    if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0)
        cout << year << " is a leap year." << endl;
    else
        cout << year << " is not a leap year." << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
